# WellMind Product Brief (MVP)

## What this is
WellMind is a low-drama wellness app that helps busy people notice early burnout signals and build small, sustainable habits. It focuses on reflection, not judgment.

## Who it serves
- Busy professionals who want quick, private check-ins.
- People who prefer gentle nudges over pressure.

## What it does (MVP)
- Daily 60-second check-in for mood/energy/stress/sleep.
- Simple trends based on recent check-ins.
- Gentle, optional suggestions based on answers.
- Optional reminders.
- Offline-first local storage; no account needed.

## What it does not do (MVP)
- No medical claims or diagnosis.
- No employer or company dashboard.
- No social features.
- No external sentiment/news analysis.

## Core experience principles
- Calm and optional. No shame, no alarm.
- Transparent and simple. No hidden scoring.
- Local-first privacy by default.

## Behavior rules (MVP)
- Check-ins are saved locally and never sent to a server.
- Suggestions are phrased as options, not instructions.
- Trends show recent patterns, not judgments.
- If there is no recent data, show neutral empty states.

## MVP screens
- Home: daily check-in entry, weekly trends, gentle tips, today’s balance, resource links.
- Check-In: sliders for energy/stress/focus/sleep, optional note, save or cancel.
- In-app browser: opens learn-more links.
- Settings (planned): reminder toggle, export/delete data.

## Future (not in MVP)
- Company mode with anonymized, aggregated signals only.

## Questions / Assumptions
- Are reminders required in MVP or can they be deferred to a later milestone?
- Should “Today’s balance” be shown only after a check-in, or with an empty state?
- Do we want a dedicated Trends screen separate from Home, or keep trends on Home only?
- What export format is expected (CSV, JSON, plain text)?
